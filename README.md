# FidoFind

## Description

Considering searching for a pet may seem difficult in terms of the “perfect fit” or suitable to future/current pet owners needs, as well to “uncertain owners, navigating an ideal pets database can be quite tricky. Taking all these factors into account, we wanted to streamline a pet finding process according to convenience, access to nearby shelters,for prospective pet owners,as well as providing options for said owners. These options can vary from ones that have an idea for the particular pet they’d like, ones that may rely on spontaneity in searching for a pet, and others who would like to rescue one and just want to find access to a shelter in close proximity to them. We hope this entire process can make finding a pet easier, and more navigable for future owners that are looking for pets, and pets that will finally be able to be situated with a comfortable new home.

The motivation stemmed from there being a lack of services in convenience towards searching for a pet as well as the lack of applications suited for this function. This can breed discouragement from people that want a future pet but feel there’s too much hurdles to jump regarding the right pet. Also, the overfull animal shelters is what are motivation can possibly alleviate this major problem.
